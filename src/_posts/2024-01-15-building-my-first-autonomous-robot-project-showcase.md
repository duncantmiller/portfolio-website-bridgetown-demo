## Project Overview

This post showcases my first major robotics project: an autonomous line-following robot built during my junior year. This project demonstrates key robotics concepts including sensor integration, control algorithms, and real-time decision making.

Project Goals:
- Build a robot that can autonomously follow a black line on a white surface
- Implement PID control for smooth navigation
- Add obstacle detection and avoidance capabilities
- Create a user-friendly interface for monitoring and control

## Technical Specifications

### Hardware Components

| Component | Model | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Microcontroller | Arduino Uno R3 | Main processing unit |
| Motors | DC Geared Motors (6V) | Robot locomotion |
| Sensors | IR Sensor Array (5 sensors) | Line detection |
| Camera | OV7670 Camera Module | Computer vision |
| Ultrasonic Sensor | HC-SR04 | Obstacle detection |
| Battery | 7.4V Li-Po Battery | Power supply |

### Software Stack

- **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE)
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `Servo.h` for servo control
  - `NewPing.h` for ultrasonic sensor
  - Custom PID controller implementation
- **Computer Vision:** Basic edge detection algorithms
- **Communication:** Serial communication for debugging

## Design Process

### 1. Initial Concept and Research

I started by researching existing line-following robots and studying different approaches:

- **Sensor-based approach:** Using IR sensors to detect line contrast
- **Vision-based approach:** Using camera for line detection
- **Hybrid approach:** Combining both methods for reliability

After analysis, I chose the **hybrid approach** for better performance in varying lighting conditions.

### 2. Mechanical Design

The chassis design focused on:
- **Stability:** Low center of gravity with wide wheelbase
- **Modularity:** Easy component mounting and replacement
- **Accessibility:** Clear access to all components for debugging

```cpp
// Example: Motor control function
void moveRobot(int leftSpeed, int rightSpeed) {
    // Constrain speeds to valid range
    leftSpeed = constrain(leftSpeed, -255, 255);
    rightSpeed = constrain(rightSpeed, -255, 255);

    // Control left motor
    if (leftSpeed >= 0) {
        digitalWrite(LEFT_MOTOR_DIR, HIGH);
        analogWrite(LEFT_MOTOR_PWM, leftSpeed);
    } else {
        digitalWrite(LEFT_MOTOR_DIR, LOW);
        analogWrite(LEFT_MOTOR_PWM, -leftSpeed);
    }

    // Control right motor
    if (rightSpeed >= 0) {
        digitalWrite(RIGHT_MOTOR_DIR, HIGH);
        analogWrite(RIGHT_MOTOR_PWM, rightSpeed);
    } else {
        digitalWrite(RIGHT_MOTOR_DIR, LOW);
        analogWrite(RIGHT_MOTOR_PWM, -rightSpeed);
    }
}
```

## Implementation Highlights

### PID Control Algorithm

The heart of the project is the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller that keeps the robot centered on the line:

```cpp
class PIDController {
private:
    float kp, ki, kd;
    float previousError;
    float integral;

public:
    PIDController(float p, float i, float d) : kp(p), ki(i), kd(d) {
        previousError = 0;
        integral = 0;
    }

    float calculate(float setpoint, float measured) {
        float error = setpoint - measured;
        integral += error;
        float derivative = error - previousError;

        float output = kp * error + ki * integral + kd * derivative;
        previousError = error;

        return output;
    }
};
```

### Sensor Fusion

I implemented a sensor fusion algorithm that combines IR sensor data with camera input:

```cpp
int calculateLinePosition() {
    // Read IR sensors
    int sensorValues[5];
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        sensorValues[i] = digitalRead(sensorPins[i]);
    }

    // Calculate weighted average
    int sum = 0, weightedSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (sensorValues[i] == 1) {  // Line detected
            sum++;
            weightedSum += i * 100;  // Weight by position
        }
    }

    if (sum > 0) {
        return weightedSum / sum - 200;  // Center at 0
    }

    return lastKnownPosition;  // Use last known position if no line detected
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Inconsistent Line Detection

**Problem:** The robot would lose the line in areas with varying lighting conditions.

**Solution:**
- Implemented adaptive thresholding
- Added calibration routine for different environments
- Combined multiple sensor types for redundancy

### Challenge 2: Oscillation Around the Line

**Problem:** The robot would zigzag excessively instead of smooth following.

**Solution:**
- Fine-tuned PID parameters through systematic testing
- Added derivative term to reduce oscillation
- Implemented speed reduction during sharp turns

### Challenge 3: Power Management

**Problem:** Battery life was insufficient for extended testing sessions.

**Solution:**
- Optimized code to reduce processing overhead
- Implemented sleep modes when stationary
- Added low-battery detection and warning system

## Results and Performance

### Quantitative Results

- **Line Following Accuracy:** 95% success rate on standard test track
- **Speed:** Average 0.5 m/s with smooth curves
- **Battery Life:** 45 minutes of continuous operation
- **Response Time:** <50ms for direction changes
